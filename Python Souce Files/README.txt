Hello Developers....

**Dont Delete Resources and Cache Folder (or) you will find yourself in trouble**

These are the required Dependencies to run the Source File:

>>PyQt5 required for GUI or just take Reference from "backend.py">>

Some other Important Libraries:-
1)pytube3
2)requests
3)ffmpeg-python [also add its "ffmpeg.exe" path (which is located in bin folder) to System Enviroment Variables]
check: [https://kkroening.github.io/ffmpeg-python/] or [https://pypi.org/project/ffmpeg-python/]
Alert:- Dont forget to add bin path in Enviroment Variables. Contact me if you face error.
4)Some Python Inbuild Libaries.
